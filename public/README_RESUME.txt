IMPORTANT: Add Your Resume PDF Here

The resume.pdf file was removed because it was corrupted.

TO FIX:
1. Open Finder
2. Go to your Downloads folder
3. Find your resume PDF (e.g., "Sachin_Singh_Resume (3).pdf")
4. Copy that file
5. Paste it in this folder (public/)
6. Rename it to exactly: resume.pdf

After adding the file, restart your dev server:
npm run dev

The download button will then work properly!
